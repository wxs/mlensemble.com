introHead: "ML Ensemble Dinner Concept"
intro: >
    We’re excited to try something a bit new with the ML Ensemble community.

introBody: >
    We’ve in the past organized conferences for a diverse group of carefully chosen highly technical machine learning leaders from industry and academia, with a focus on building community and  sharing knowledge.


    To double down on this exchange of ideas, and encourage the participation of the entire amazing ML Ensemble community, we are prototyping a new model, and organizing an even smaller group dinner of 15-20 people focused on a facilitated discussion of issues relevant to the group.


    For our first dinner we will be talking about climate crisis.


    Climate crisis, and ecological collapse, is upon us. Significant changes in our worldviews and ways of life are upcoming, and all communities are called to participate in strategies of mitigation and adaptation. We can either change or die.


    The machine learning community is currently extremely powerful and influential. However many of us have trouble knowing how we can bring our particular skill set to bear on this critical issue. A first step is for us to be having these conversations with each other. Themes that could come up:

     - How might we participate in this global movement?
     - Can ML and technology help move things in the right direction?
     - Where might it move things in the wrong direction?
     - How can we work with other groups tackling these questions?
     - Is there a danger of techno-solutionism diverting resources from better places?



highlights:
    - heading: Academics & Industry
      body: Learn about research frontiers from academia; learn about applied realities from industry

    - heading: Technically In-Depth
      body: This is not a marketing meeting. Discussion will not shy away from necessary mathematical and technical details.

    - heading: Conversational
      body: We are limiting the event size to allow for actual discussion, and leaving plenty of time for it in the schedule.
