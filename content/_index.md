introHead: "ML Ensemble Dinner Concept"
intro: >
    We’re excited to try something a bit new with the ML Ensemble community.

introBody: >
    We’ve in the past organized conferences for a diverse group of carefully chosen highly technical machine learning leaders from industry and academia, with a focus on building community and  sharing knowledge.


    To double down on this exchange of ideas, and encourage the participation of the entire amazing ML Ensemble community, we are prototyping a new model, and organizing an even smaller group dinner of 15-20 people focused on a facilitated discussion of issues relevant to the group.


    For our first dinner we will be talking about climate crisis.


    Climate crisis, and ecological collapse, is upon us. Significant changes in our worldviews and ways of life are upcoming, and all communities are called to participate in strategies of mitigation and adaptation. We can either change or die.


    The machine learning community is currently extremely powerful and influential. However many of us have trouble knowing how we can bring our particular skill set to bear on this critical issue. A first step is for us to be having these conversations with each other. Themes that could come up:

     - How might we participate in this global movement?
     - Can ML and technology help move things in the right direction?
     - Where might it move things in the wrong direction?
     - How can we work with other groups tackling these questions?
     - Is there a danger of techno-solutionism diverting resources from better places?

    ## Reading

    So that we have some shared experience to level-set the group, we would like every participant to at least have read the recent [Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05433) paper, with many prominent AI researchers as co-authors.

    For the keen, we further suggest reading:

     - Bret Victor’s excellent [What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/).
     - The recently viral, significantly more pessimistic [Deep Adaptation](https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf) paper, arguing that the case for significant social collapse is under-represented as there are major structural incentives to discourage such thought in the public arena. The paper has since led to global Deep Adaptation communities across disciplines working to understand how we might build society in the remnants of the one we are losing
     - [Project Drawdown](https://www.drawdown.org/) is less CS and ML specific, but provides many concrete suggestions of what we might do to mitigate, and is globally very influential, with global communities including [one in Toronto](https://drawdowntoronto.ca/)
